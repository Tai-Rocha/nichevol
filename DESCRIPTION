Description: A set of tools to perform critical steps in the process of 
    assessment of species' ecological niche evolution considering uncertainty 
    in reconstructions. The method proposed here for ancestral reconstruction of
    ecological niches characterizes species' niches using a bin-based approach 
    that incorporates uncertainty in estimations. Compared to other existent 
    methods the approaches presented here reduce risks of overestimation of 
    ecological niche evolution. The main analyses include: initial exploration of 
    environmental data in species records and accessible areas, preparation of 
    data for phylogenetic analyses, comparative phylogenetic analyses, and
    plotting for interpretations.
